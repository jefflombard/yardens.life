### The Purpose

Philly Yardens Association is a nonprofit entity with a three-fold mission: increase access to healthy food, build community around food security and gardening, and rebuild urban soils. We live our mission by converting residential grass lawns and ornamental spaces to sustainable, food-productive gardens without sacrificing the beauty of the space. Our services are rendered on a 'Pay-What-You-Can' sliding scale to ensure that all members of the community can participate.
