## Why We Exist

Between 1989 and 2005, the price of fruits and vegetables in the US increased by 75 percent. Because of this healthy eating is out of reach for many residents.

We can do better.

### Our Solution

Our solution is the "Philly Yarden". A philly yarden is a yard that is converted into a food producing garden.

Benefits of having a philly yarden:

        <li class="solution__bullet">Join a community of people to trade the food you grow</li>
    </ul>

### How do I get a Philly Yarden?

We will set up a food productive garden at your residence for you. We operate on a 'Pay-What-You-Can' sliding scale to ensure that all members of the community can participate.

The full cost of installing a Philly Yardens installation (including material cost) will be communicated to our clients, who are welcomed to contribute as much as they can afford. No prospective clients will be turned down due to an inability to pay.
