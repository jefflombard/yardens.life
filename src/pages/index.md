question: How do I get a Philly Yarden?
answer: We will set up a food productive garden at your residence for you. We operate on a 'Pay-What-You-Can' sliding scale to ensure that all members of the community can participate. The full cost of installing a Philly Yardens installation (including material cost) will be communicated to our clients, who are welcomed to contribute as much as they can afford. No prospective clients will be turned down due to an inability to pay.

  title: Why We Exist
  description: >
    Between 1989 and 2005, the price of fruits and vegetables in the US
    increased by 75 percent. Because of this healthy eating is out of reach for
    many residents.


    We can do better.

  Our solution is the "Philly Yarden". A philly yarden is a yard that is
  converted into a food producing garden.  Benefits of having a philly yarden: 
  Easy access to healthy food. Less maintenance than a typical ornamental yard.
  (No lawn mowing fees, etc.) Join a community of people to trade the food you
  grow

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
