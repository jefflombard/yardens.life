### The Purpose

Philly Yardens Association is a nonprofit entity with a three-fold mission: increase access to healthy food, build community around food security and gardening, and rebuild urban soils. We live our mission by converting residential grass lawns and ornamental spaces to sustainable, food-productive gardens without sacrificing the beauty of the space. Our services are rendered on a 'Pay-What-You-Can' sliding scale to ensure that all members of the community can participate.

### The Plan

Our services will be rolled out and optimized in phases. We'll start by offering front yard conversion and ongoing maintenance services. We'll then offer back yard conversion services. Finally, we plan to develop sustainable, food-productive raised beds (for folks with concrete front and back yards) and plant-based soil remediation systems.

In the current phase, front yard conversion services will be available in West Philadelphia (48th to 58th Streets, Chestnut St. to Baltimore Avenue) only. If you're interested in having a Philly Yarden and you reside in our operating zone, please drop us a line below (be sure to include your address), please drop us a line below! If you're not in our operating zone, please join our mailing list and we'll let you know when we're ready for you!
