## Why We Exist

Between 1989 and 2005, the price of fruits and vegetables in the US increased by 75 percent. It costs a family of four approximately $2200 more per year to eat a healthy diet than an unhealthy diet (2013, Harvard School of Public Health). The problem is only getting worse, pushing healthy eating out of reach for many residents.

We can do better.
